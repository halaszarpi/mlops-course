# Lifecycle of Artificial Intelligence Systems

A 14-week, hands-on MLOps course for software-engineering students. One running
example — a diabetes-prediction pipeline — is carried from a script to a
monitored production service, adding one lifecycle capability each week
(reproducible runtimes, experiment tracking, data versioning, validation,
evaluation gates, CI/CT, orchestration, serving, rollout, observability, drift,
and governance).

## Materials are released week by week

This repository grows as the term goes. Each week's lecture deck, lab starter
and study notes appear on the **morning of that week's lecture**; homework
briefs appear in the week the syllabus says they are handed out; reference
solutions appear the week after the lab.

[`RELEASED.md`](RELEASED.md) lists what is out and the date each
remaining week arrives.

## Getting the materials

### Once in Week 1:

**Fork this repository, then keep it up to date.** The fork is yours to commit
lab work into; the `upstream` remote is where new weeks come from.

```bash
# 1. Fork on GitHub (the "Fork" button), or with the GitHub CLI:
gh repo fork VIHIBXAV054-00/mlops-course --clone --remote
cd mlops-course

# 2. If you forked in the browser instead, clone your fork and add upstream:
# git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/mlops-course.git
# cd mlops-course
# git remote add upstream https://github.com/VIHIBXAV054-00/mlops-course.git

# 3. Check it worked — you want BOTH origin (yours) and upstream (the course):
git remote -v

# 4. Make `git pull` merge the new week into your work, not rebase it:
git config pull.rebase false
```

### Every week, before the lab:

```bash
git pull upstream main      # merge the new week into your fork
git push                    # update your fork on GitHub
```

Work only in the lab folder of the week, `labs/week-XX-topic/starter/`. The
course changes the other files every week. If you edit only your lab folder,
the pull merges without a conflict.

If git says that your local changes would be overwritten, you have work that is
not committed yet. Commit it (see below), then pull again.

### After the lab: commit and submit

```bash
git add labs/week-XX-topic/starter
git commit -m "Week XX lab"
git push
git log -1 --format=%H      # the commit ID (SHA) to submit
```

Submit the URL of that commit in the week's Moodle assignment:
`https://github.com/<your-username>/mlops-course/commit/<SHA>`. Open the
URL before you submit: if GitHub shows your changes, the link is right.

Never rebase `main` and never use `git push --force`. Both change the commit
IDs, and the commits you submitted in Moodle would disappear from your fork.

### If the pull reports a conflict

A conflict means that the course corrected a lab file that you also edited. The
course announcement says which file changed. Your work is safe in your commits.

```bash
git status                  # lists the files with a conflict
# In each file, keep the lines you need and delete the
# <<<<<<<, ======= and >>>>>>> marker lines.
git add <file>
git commit                  # finishes the merge
git push
```

To stop and go back to the state before the pull: `git merge --abort`.

Do not edit a conflict in `uv.lock` by hand. Resolve `pyproject.toml` first if
it also has a conflict, then take the course version of the lock and lock again:

```bash
cd labs/week-XX-topic/starter
git checkout --theirs uv.lock
uv lock
git add uv.lock
```

Do **not** push to `upstream`; you have no write access to it, by design.

## Prerequisites (one-time setup)

You need a laptop with **16 GB RAM** and:

- **Git** — https://git-scm.com/
- **uv** (Python project/dependency manager) — https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/
- **Docker Desktop / Docker Engine + Compose** — https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/ (needed from Week 2 onward)
- **kind** — https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation (needed from Week 9 onward)
- **kubectl** — https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/ (needed from Week 9 onward)

`kind` runs a Kubernetes cluster inside Docker; both are single binaries and neither needs a
cloud account. From Week 9, **do not run the Compose stack and the cluster at the same time** because the Week 9 serving container is self-contained.

From **Week 10** the cluster also runs a serving control plane (cert-manager, Istio, Knative and
KServe): about 2.5 GB of images and ~2.3 GiB of RAM, installed by a `make` target in the lab. Keep the Compose stack down that week.

**Week 11 is the reverse**: delete the cluster (`kind delete cluster --name mlops`) and bring the
Compose stack back, now with Prometheus and Grafana alongside the existing four services. Nothing
that week needs Kubernetes.

**Week 12 adds nothing to install and nothing to run.** The cluster stays down, the Compose stack
stays up, and there is **no new service and no new port** — because the drift monitor is a *job*
rather than a server. It does add one substantial Python dependency (`evidently`), and it is declared
in a dependency **group**.

**Week 13 adds one container.** Alertmanager on **5570**, pinned in `compose.yaml`, with `amtool` inside it — so there is no new host tool either. Governance turns out to
be `hashlib`, `json`, string formatting and YAML: `uv.lock` moves by the project name and nothing else. The cluster stays down.

**Week 14 has no lab.** The syllabus reserves the slot as a spare session; the lecture is a summary and an LLMOps outlook, and the revision guide for the written exam is `docs/exam-revision.md`, published in Week 13.

Python itself is installed for you by `uv`. Windows, macOS, and Linux are all supported.

## Running a lab

Each lab is a self-contained `uv` project. From a lab's `starter/` directory:

```bash
uv sync --all-groups       # create the environment from the lockfile
uv run python src/main.py  # run the pipeline
uv run pytest -v           # run the tests
```

Labs from Week 2 onward also start local services with one command:

```bash
docker compose up -d --wait
```

Per-lab `README.md` files give the exact steps, expected output, and the
official tutorial each lab is based on.

## Homework & your project

The five homework assignments are **not** done in this repository. In Week 2 you
create your own **private** project repo from the project template — click *Use
this template* on **<https://github.com/VIHIBXAV054-00/mlops-project-template>** — and grow it across HW1-HW5.

In Week 2 you also choose a dataset and prediction task (see
[`homework/project-topic/`](homework/project-topic/)) that you carry through all
five homework assignments. Need ideas? See the
[dataset catalogue](datasets/README.md).
