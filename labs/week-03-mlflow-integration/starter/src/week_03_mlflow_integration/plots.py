"""Diagnostic plots, built as figures so MLflow can log them as artifacts.

New in Week 3. Two design rules worth copying into your own projects:

1. The backend is forced to "Agg" BEFORE pyplot is imported. Otherwise
   matplotlib may pick a GUI backend (likely on macOS) and try to open a
   window from a background process.
2. These functions RETURN a Figure and never call plt.show() or plt.savefig().
   Returning the figure is what makes them unit-testable with no MLflow server
   and no files on disk — the caller decides what to do with it.

    TODO(student) — Exercise 2: draw the ROC curve of `model` on the test set

    Give the axes a title that contains "ROC", call fig.tight_layout() so the
    labels are not cut off, and return the figure. Do not show or save it: the
