"""The model registry: versions, aliases, governance tags, and traceability.

New in Week 3. Tracking answers "which run scored best?". It cannot answer
"what are we serving?" — for that you need a NAME, a stable address, an approval
record, and a rollback target. That is the registry.

Four nouns:
  registered model  a name, e.g. "diabetes-classifier"
  version           an immutable, numbered snapshot of one run's model
  alias             a MUTABLE pointer to exactly one version: models:/<name>@staging
  tag               a recorded fact attached to a version (who promoted it, on what)

Note what is absent: model *stages*. MLflow deprecated the fixed
None/Staging/Production/Archived state machine in 2.9 and the official registry
tutorial now uses aliases exclusively. See the lab README for the one-line
deviation note, and the lecture for why the change was an improvement.

    "Promote to staging" is two things, and only the second is an API call:

      1. A GATE — evidence that this version deserves to be promoted. Here that
         evidence is recorded as version tags. Designing real gates (metric
         regression thresholds, slice metrics, fairness checks, go/no-go rules)
         is Week 6's topic; this week is the mechanism.
      2. A POINTER MOVE — `set_registered_model_alias`. Nothing is copied. The
         version does not change. Only the name now resolves elsewhere.

    TODO(student) — Exercise 6, part 1. Using the `client` below:

    A. Read the evidence from the version's SOURCE RUN, not from a variable you
       happen to hold, so the tags cannot drift from what was measured.
    B. Tag the VERSION with these keys (the tests check the names):
         validation_f1, validation_roc_auc   the run's metrics, formatted "%.4f"
